    "1) How would you define Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has been used both scientific and business study field to extract useful information from hidden pattern of data. Because it is not possible to analyze and process the data in very large quantities in the traditional way. For this reason, machine learning methods have been developed to analyze big data.\n"

    "4) What are the main preprocessing steps? Explain them in detail. Why we need to prepare our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Taking care of missing values in dataset\n",
    "    We may find some data are missing in the dataset. We need to be equipped to handle the problem when we come across them. We eliminates missing values in this step and filling with mean or median.\n",

    "2. Outlier detection\n",
    "    Standart Deviation, Box Plots / IQR Calculation and Isolation Forest can bu used as on outlier detection model of dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Feature scaling\n",
    "    Standadization (also called, Z-score normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that they’ll have the properties of a standard normal distribution with mean,μ=0 and standard deviation, σ=1; where μ is the mean (average) and σ is the standard deviation from the mean.\n",
    "    Normalization (also called, Min-Max normalization) is a scaling technique such that when it is applied the features will be rescaled so that the data will fall in the range of [0,1].\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Bucketting (Binning)\n",
    "    Data binning, bucketing is a data pre-processing method used to minimize the effects of small observation errors (noisy data). The original data values are divided into small intervals known as bins and then they are replaced by a general value calculated for that bin.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Feature Extraction \n",
    "    Feature extraction refers to the process of transforming raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original data set. It yields better results than applying machine learning directly to the raw data. Some feature extraction methods are: \n",

    "6. Feature Encoding\n",
    "    Feature encoding is basically performing transformations on the data such that it can be easily accepted as input for machine learning algorithms while still retaining its original meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Splitting dataset as traning set, validation set and testing set\n",
    "    Before we start deciding the algorithm which should be used, it is always advised to split the dataset into two or sometimes three parts. Machine Learning algorithms, or any algorithm for that matter, has to be first trained on the data distribution available and then validated and tested, before it can be deployed to deal with real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data preparation can be defined that the process of cleaning and transforming raw data prior to processing and analysis. In this step, we load our data into a suitable place and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. \n",
